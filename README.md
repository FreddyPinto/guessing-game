# Guessing Game
This project is a guessing game developed as part of my learning path at [Mimo](https://mimo.org/). The goal is to create an interactive game where users can guess a number randomly generated by the program.

## How to play?

- When starting the game, a random number is generated within a defined range.
- The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number.
- With each incorrect attempt, the game provides clues to help the player get closer to the correct number.
